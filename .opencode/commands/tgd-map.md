**🔑 Step 0: $TGD_DIR Resolution**

$TGD_DIR is where ALL tGD artifacts live. It is a **sibling directory** outside your code repo.

Resolution (in order):
1. If symlink `tGD/` exists in project root → `readlink tGD` → that's `$TGD_DIR`
2. If env var `$TGD_DIR` is set → use it, create symlink: `ln -s $TGD_DIR tGD`
3. Otherwise → auto-create:
   ```
   PROJECT_NAME=$(basename $(pwd))
   TGD_DIR="../${PROJECT_NAME}-tGD"
   mkdir -p "$TGD_DIR"
   ln -s "$TGD_DIR" tGD
   export TGD_DIR=$(realpath tGD)
   ```

Result:
```
~/my-project/              ← your code (current dir)
├── src/
├── tGD → ../my-project-tGD/   ← symlink

~/my-project-tGD/          ← $TGD_DIR (all artifacts here)
├── CONTEXT.md
├── .scans/
└── <feature>/
```

After this step, ALL subsequent commands use `tGD/` (the symlink) to find `$TGD_DIR`.

## Step 1: Context Discovery

Before analyzing anything, ask the user:

> "除了當前 repo，還有其他需要參考的 repo 嗎？（local path 或 git URL）"

- Accept **local paths** (e.g. `~/Projects/wayflow`) — resolve to absolute path
- Accept **git URLs** (e.g. `github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit`) — clone to `/tmp/tgd-context/<repo-name>`
- If user says "no" or provides nothing, proceed with primary repo only
- Store results for CONTEXT.md (see structure below)

## Step 2: Context Engineering

Run the `context-engineering` skill. Analyze the current project: tech stack, architecture, dependencies, code organization, and existing patterns.

## Step 3: CodeGraph Setup

For each repo to map (primary + all additional repos from Step 1):

1. Ensure output dir exists: `mkdir -p $TGD_DIR/.scans/<repo-name>`
2. Create symlink: `rm -rf <repo-path>/.codegraph && ln -s $TGD_DIR/.scans/<repo-name>/.codegraph <repo-path>/.codegraph`
3. cd into the repo and run: `codegraph init -i`

## Step 4: Understand-Anything (MANDATORY)

This step is **required**, not optional.

For each repo to map (primary + all additional repos from Step 1):

1. Create symlink: `rm -rf <repo-path>/.understand-anything && ln -s $TGD_DIR/.scans/<repo-name>/.understand-anything <repo-path>/.understand-anything`
2. cd into the repo and run `/understand` to build a full knowledge graph
3. This produces `$TGD_DIR/.scans/<repo-name>/.understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json`
4. After ALL repos are mapped, run `/understand-dashboard` from the primary repo to launch the interactive visualization
5. If unfamiliar with any repo, run `/understand-onboard` for a guided tour

Dashboard is launched only once from the primary repo — it reads the primary's knowledge graph. To inspect additional repos visually, run `/understand-dashboard` from each repo path separately.

## Step 5: Produce CONTEXT.md

**Outputs (all under `$TGD_DIR/`):**
- `CONTEXT.md` — project structure analysis (MUST reference CodeGraph/UA data)
- `.scans/<repo>/.codegraph/codegraph.db` — symbol index (via symlink)
- `.scans/<repo>/.understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json` — full knowledge graph (via symlink)
- `.scans/<repo>/.understand-anything/config.json` — UA configuration
- **Interactive dashboard** — launched via `/understand-dashboard` (localhost)

**CONTEXT.md Structure:**
When writing `CONTEXT.md`, DO NOT rely solely on visual inspection of code.
Synthesize data from the tools:

```markdown
# CONTEXT.md

## 1. Primary Repository
**Path:** <absolute path>
**Name:** <repo name>

### Structure
<directory tree>

### Key Files
<important files and their roles>

### Summary
<tech stack, architecture, patterns — from UA knowledge graph>

### Code Entry Points
<from CodeGraph>

## 2. Additional Context Repositories
(For each additional repo provided in Step 1:)

### <repo-name> (<type: local_path | git_url>)
**Source:** <original input>
**Resolved to:** <absolute path or clone path>
**Summary:** <what this repo does>

**Key Insights:**
- <insight 1>
- <insight 2>

**Relevance:** <why this repo is relevant to the primary project>

## 3. Synthesis
### Integration Points
- <how repos relate to each other>

### Architecture Decisions
- <key decisions based on combined context>

### Open Questions
- <unresolved questions>
## See Also
- Interactive Dashboard: http://localhost:<port>
```

## Step 6: Verification Gate

- [ ] `$TGD_DIR/CONTEXT.md` exists and is non-empty
- [ ] `$TGD_DIR/.scans/<repo>/.codegraph` symlink exists
- [ ] `$TGD_DIR/.scans/<repo>/.understand-anything` symlink exists
- [ ] `$TGD_DIR/.scans/<repo>/.understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json` exists
- [ ] If additional repos were provided, their summaries appear in CONTEXT.md

If verification passes, suggest the next step: `/tgd-define` to start defining what to build.
